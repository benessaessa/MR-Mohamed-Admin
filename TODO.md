# TODO: Implement Users Management Table in teacher-users.html

## Approved Plan
- Replace the main content (stats cards, chart, and courses section) with a users management section.
- Include a table displaying users with columns: ID, Name, Email, Role, Status, Actions.
- Add search input for filtering users.
- Add filter dropdowns (e.g., by role or status).
- Add export button (for CSV/PDF using JavaScript).
- Add pagination controls.
- Add action buttons: Add (main button), Edit, Delete, each opening a modal popup.
- Add modals for adding a new user, editing an existing user, and confirming deletion.
- Use dummy data for demonstration.
- Ensure integration with Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling and dark mode support.
